//1. Add buttons for each sound//
// and text instructions for keyboard press //

//2. Create an event listener that tracks a key pressed anywhere on the page//
//-test console log//

//3. Use the event object to check what key you've pressed
-console log the code value//

//4. Only tun some code when you click on a specific key
-console log//

//5. Replace tat console log with plaing the sound file when pressed//
-I'll be able hear the result
//5.5 Research how to play audio//

//6. Repeating that for the other sound files and assigning a key//
//-can play all sounds from keyboard//

//7. Add event listener to a single buttons
-console log a message on click//
Did it by class selector and ForEach - I've got a function applying a clicker to each button and linked sounds,
BUT it plays ALL the sounds at once
If I can fix this, I'll be able to replicate with kepress and that'll cover steps 7,8,9

8. Replace the log with correct sound
-Similar code to "keybind"

9. Repeat for each buttons

9b (OPTIONAL!) try to condense the code
-Loop through them?

10. Pretty it up
